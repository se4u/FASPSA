Fast adaptive SPSA

This repository contains the folders `tex` and `src`.
The `src` repository contains the code used to perform
the speed-accuracy evaluations of Fast Adaptive SPSA.

The algorithms are written in the files.
| SPSA.m                           |
| Adaptive2SPSA.m                  |
| FeedbackAdaptive2SPSA.m          |
| EfficientAdaptive2SPSA.m         |
| EfficientFeedbackAdaptive2SPSA.m |

These algorithms were called by the main functions in `sso_project.m`
which were used to generate plots and tables for the paper on the
`quartic` and `rosenbrock` functions.



TODO : 25 November
1. I would implement theta based blocking (for the noisy case) and report results using that on the same problem.
    And professor spall would email the code used in noisy 2SPSA in the 2000 paper.

2. Code the loss to be faster in fortran, and read up on possible ways to speed up the preconditioning.
   Either through Boryden type updates or just using the hack of keeping the diagonal values.
   Or look at the size of gershgorin disks.
   This will speed up the rest of the code.

3. Formalize the use of the MIL for the 2SG case (in addition to the current 2SPSA case), both w/ and w/o feedback.
